# DatabaseGenerator project

this folder contains the Visual Studio project and the executables

## git

git.exe location must be present into the PATH environment variable, because the pre-build step of the project uses git to put the commit hash into the assembly info. If this is not the case, it's possible to comment out or remove the statements of the pre-build steps.
